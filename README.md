Description: XML Sitemap Generator
An XML sitemap is a crucial aspect of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) as it helps search engines understand the structure of a website. The sitemap lists the URLs of a site along with metadata such as last modified dates, change frequency, and priority of each page.

Using the provided JSON-to-XML conversion code, you can generate an XML sitemap from structured JSON data that contains information about your website's URLs. This is particularly useful when you're working with APIs that return data in JSON format or when you want to dynamically create sitemaps based on the content of your application.

Key Features of an XML Sitemap:
Structure: The XML is structured in a way that makes it easy for search engines to crawl and index the site.
Last Modified Date: Indicates when a page was last updated, helping search engines prioritize crawling fresh content.
Change Frequency: Tells search engines how often to check for changes on a particular page, optimizing their crawling efficiency.
Priority: Allows site owners to highlight important pages they want search engines to focus on.
By using the conversion process, you can customize and expand the JSON input to include all any relevant information pertaining to the pages of your site, creating a comprehensive XML sitemap that enhances your site's visibility on search engines.
